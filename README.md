# Data-Structures

### 1- What is a Data Structures? 
it's just a way to organize data and operations over them 
### 2- Why Data Structures?
array is limited what if you want to delete element or add element? 

so you need to create something more dynamic

#### there is built in Data Structures in almost all programming language 
#### for example in c++ built in data structure called STLs, in Java and C# called collections
this is because there are common tasks and during software history we could recognize them 
some data and operation on them are common and repetitive 
### 3- Why not just use built in DS?
using built in DS as a black box without understanding their details is a big risk 

- you need to realize time and memory order
- you will not be able to recognize the difference between different DS 
- from time to time you will be need to build your own DS


<hr>

in order to understand DS you need to have a basic OOP knowledge
